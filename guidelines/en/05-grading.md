While grading, we use a "**matching**" approach instead of using the traditional "**grading**" approach. So we'll seek for similarities/differences between your skills and the project we maintain. In short, we're not here to judge your abilities. We're here just to find a proper match for our JavaScript project.

What we expect from a developer is, the one, to fit into the "`B1`-`B2`" matching scale in the image below. While deciding the match, we use your solution to the "case study", the "General Questions" section below and the "interview process" itself as the input.

We defined two focus types in the "`B1`-`B2`" scale. We consider both behavioural types as equal. "**Solution-Focused**" developers are the ones who are the rockstars of coding. They are capable of solving business problems without having solid domain knowledge. "**Problem-Focused**" developers on-the-other-hand are the ones who are more into defining problem domain, understanding the business culture of the company, having critical thinking and communication skills, ... Saying again they are both equal matches for the project.

In the technical evaluation of the case study, we expect solution-focused developers to have complete control over their code in the case study. We look for a minimum number of code errors and no build process misconfigurations. For problem-focused developers, we're more flexible on the coding abilities side. Here, we look for the abilities you have around solid problem domain understanding, scalability foresight, ...

To be clear, here are the short descriptions for the matching scale:

- `A`: Developers who are able to switch between focus types by the definition of the business problem.
- `B1`-`B2`: Developers whose focus type is naturally problem-focused or solution-focused.
- `C`: Developers who are out-of-the matching scale.
